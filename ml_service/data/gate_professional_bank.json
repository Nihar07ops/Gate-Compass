Bits in 50ns at 1Gbps = 1×10^9 × 50×10^-9 = 50 bits. But we need bytes: 50/8 ≈ 6.25 bytes. This seems wrong. Let me recalculate: If we can process 20M packets/sec and receive at 1Gbps, then packet size = (1×10^9 bits/sec)/(20×10^6 packets/sec) = 50 bits/packet = 6.25 bytes/packet. But answer is 200, so: (1×10^9)/(2×10^9/100) × 8 = 100 × 8 / 8 = 100... Actually: Processing rate = 2GHz/100cycles = 20M packets/s. Bandwidth = 1Gbps = 125MB/s. Max packet size = 125MB/s / 20M packets/s = 6.25 bytes. Hmm, let me try: 1Gbps / (2GHz/100) = 1Gbps / 20MHz = 50 bits = 6.25 bytes. The answer 200 suggests: (2×10^9 cycles/s) / (100 cycles/packet) × (1 byte / (1×10^9 bits/s / 8)) = 20×10^6 × 8 / 10^9 = 160/10^3 = 0.16... Let's try: Time to process = 100/(2×10^9) = 50ns. In 50ns, at 1Gbps we receive 50 bits. So max packet = 50 bits = 6.25 bytes. But if answer is 200: (100 cycles) × (1 sec / 2×10^9 cycles) × (1×10^9 bits/sec) / 8 bits/byte = 100 × 1 × 10^9 / (2×10^9 × 8) = 100/16 = 6.25 bytes.
