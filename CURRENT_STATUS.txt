Session: Numerical Questions Fix

ISSUE FIXED
-----------
✅ Questions were too straightforward
✅ Difficulty not matching selection
✅ No numerical questions appearing

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED
--------------------
✅ Fixed difficulty mapping (beginner/intermediate/advanced → easy/medium/hard)
✅ Merged all question sources into unified bank (408 questions)
✅ Reclassified questions by actual difficulty
✅ Added 10 new complex numerical questions
✅ Created comprehensive testing suite

CURRENT STATISTICS
------------------
Total Questions: 408
├── Easy: 143 (35%) - 0 numerical
├── Medium: 215 (53%) - 0 numerical
└── Hard: 50 (12%) - 39 numerical (78%)

Numerical Questions: 39 total
- All in Hard difficulty
- Multi-step calculations required
- 2-3 marks each
- Cover all major CS topics

SERVERS RUNNING
---------------
✅ Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (npm run dev)
✅ Backend: http://localhost:5000 (node server/server-inmemory.js)

TESTING
-------
To test the fix:
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Navigate to Mock Tests
3. Select "Hard" difficulty
4. Choose Custom format
5. Start test
6. Expected: ~15-16 numerical questions out of 20 (78%)

VERIFICATION
------------
Run these commands to verify:

# Test difficulty filtering
python ml_service/data/test_difficulty_filter.py

# Show sample questions
python ml_service/data/show_advanced_samples.py

# Check question quality
python ml_service/data/check_hard_questions.py
