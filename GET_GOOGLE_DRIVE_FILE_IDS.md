# 📋 How to Get Google Drive File IDs for Direct PDF Links

## 🎯 What We Need

To make "Read Online" open PDFs directly (not the folder), we need individual Google Drive file IDs for each book.

## 📝 Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Open Your Google Drive Folder
Go to: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bD86aqby1shKZxN3pIOJoJ0rGZxA8Zcr

### 2. For Each PDF File:

1. **Right-click** on the PDF file
2. **Select "Get link"** or **"Share"**
3. **Copy the link** (it looks like this):
   ```
   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BvhqkMxvNF6umJVYnandJTjq8U_5CLRS/view?usp=sharing
   ```
4. **Extract the File ID** (the part between `/d/` and `/view`):
   ```
   File ID: 1BvhqkMxvNF6umJVYnandJTjq8U_5CLRS
   ```

### 3. Books We Need File IDs For:

Please get the file IDs for these books and send them to me:

#### Algorithms & Data Structures:
- [ ] **Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS)** - File ID: `_____________`
- [ ] **Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy** - File ID: `_____________`
- [ ] **Algorithm Design Manual** - File ID: `_____________`

#### Operating Systems:
- [ ] **Operating System Concepts (Dinosaur Book)** - File ID: `_____________`
- [ ] **Modern Operating Systems** - File ID: `_____________`
- [ ] **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces** - File ID: `_____________`

#### Database Management:
- [ ] **Database System Concepts** - File ID: `_____________`
- [ ] **Fundamentals of Database Systems** - File ID: `_____________`

#### Computer Networks:
- [ ] **Computer Networks (Tanenbaum)** - File ID: `_____________`
- [ ] **Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach** - File ID: `_____________`

#### Theory of Computation:
- [ ] **Introduction to the Theory of Computation (Sipser)** - File ID: `_____________`
- [ ] **Elements of the Theory of Computation** - File ID: `_____________`

#### Compiler Design:
- [ ] **Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (Dragon Book)** - File ID: `_____________`

#### Software Engineering:
- [ ] **Software Engineering (Sommerville)** - File ID: `_____________`

#### Mathematics:
- [ ] **Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications (Rosen)** - File ID: `_____________`
- [ ] **Mathematics for Computer Science (MIT)** - File ID: `_____________`

## 🚀 What Happens After We Get File IDs

Once you provide the file IDs, I'll update the code so that:

1. **"Read Online"** → Opens the specific PDF directly in Google Drive viewer
2. **"Download"** → Downloads the specific PDF file directly
3. **No more folder browsing** → Direct access to each book

## 📋 Example Format

Send me the file IDs in this format:
```
Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS): 1BvhqkMxvNF6umJVYnandJTjq8U_5CLRS
Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy: 1XYZ123ABC456DEF789GHI012JKL345MNO
Algorithm Design Manual: 1ABC789XYZ123DEF456GHI789JKL012MNO
...
```

## 🔧 Alternative: Quick Test with One Book

If you want to test this immediately:
1. Get the file ID for just **one book** (like CLRS)
2. Send it to me
3. I'll update that one book to show you how it works
4. Then we can do the rest

## 💡 Pro Tip

You can also:
1. Select all PDFs in the folder
2. Right-click → "Get link" 
3. This might give you all links at once (depending on Google Drive interface)

**Once we have the file IDs, clicking "Read Online" will open the specific PDF directly - no more searching needed!**
